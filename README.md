# Amazon-EDA
## Project Overview

This project performs an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset of Amazon prime, including movies and TV shows. The analysis aims to uncover insights into content trends, viewer preferences, and potential areas for business optimization.

## Business Objective

To leverage insights derived from analyzing the Amazon titles and credits datasets to increase user engagement and subscriber retention by optimizing content strategy, personalization, and marketing efforts.

**Key Focus Areas:**

* **Content Acquisition and Production:** Identifying content gaps and emerging trends to inform content decisions.
* **Personalization and Recommendations:** Developing more effective recommendation systems based on user preferences.
* **Programming and Scheduling:** Optimizing content scheduling to maximize viewership and engagement.
* **Targeted Marketing and Promotion:** Leveraging audience insights to craft more compelling marketing campaigns.

## Dataset

The project utilizes two datasets:

* **titles.csv:** Contains information about Amazon tv shows titles, including title, type, release year, genre, runtime, IMDb score, etc.
* **credits.csv:** Provides details about the cast and crew for each title.

## Analysis and Visualizations

The project employs various data analysis and visualization techniques, including:

* **Univariate Analysis:** Exploring individual variables and their distributions.
* **Bivariate Analysis:** Examining relationships between two variables.
* **Multivariate Analysis:** Investigating relationships involving multiple variables.
* **Visualizations:** Creating charts and graphs to communicate insights effectively (e.g., bar plots, histograms, box plots, scatter plots).

## Business Impact

The insights gained from this analysis can inform Amazon's content strategy, personalize recommendations, optimize programming, and support targeted marketing efforts, leading to increased user engagement and subscriber retention.

## Tools and Technologies

* **Python:** Programming language used for data analysis and visualization.
* **Pandas:** Library for data manipulation and analysis.
* **NumPy:** Library for numerical computing.
* **Matplotlib:** Library for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations.
* **Seaborn:** Library for statistical data visualization.
* **Jupyter Notebook:** Interactive computing environment for data analysis and visualization.
